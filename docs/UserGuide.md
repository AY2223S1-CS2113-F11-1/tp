### List everything `list -everything`
Lists all information about every client and every property in the list

### Find Client and Property: `find`
This feature allows for the queried text to be filtered. The queried text is not constrained within any field.
This means that if the queried text matches the name of the first list and the address of second list, both entries
will be counted as a match.

<u>Format:</u> 
`find -CLIENT/PROPERTY f/QUERY_TEXT`

3 fields are required to be entered for successful operation:
- Command: In the context of this feature, the command will be `find`
- Client/Property: This section requires the selection of either client or property which is inputted after `-`.
- Query Text: After the tag `f/`, enter the text that will be searched through.

<u>Example:</u>

1. `find -property f/Bob The Builder`
2. `find -client f/Amos`

The 1st command above search through the property list for any matches with `Bob the Builder` while the 2nd command 
search through the client list for any matches with `Amos`.
### Exit: `quit`

---
### Loading data
The loading of the data occurs during the start of the program, before any command is entered.
There will be 3 different loading operations:
- Client
- Property
- Pairing

Clients will be added to a list containing the clients if the data stored in `client.txt` conforms to the format. 
Before appending into the list, it will also be passed through a check to ensure each of the entity is in the right 
format. Should the data fail to be in the correct format, it won't be stored into list. 

Similar operation can be applied to the `property list` where the data is stored in `property.txt`. The entries will 
also be checked that it was stored in the right format and each of the entries conforms to the requirement before it's 
added into the list containing all the property.

The `pairing list` will be the last to load. This is done so to verify that the client and property is within the 
Client's list and Property's list respectively. In the scenario where either of the entries is not in, the **pair 
would not be loaded and will be considered as incorrect data inputted**.

### Saving data

Saving of data occurs in 3 instances of operation:

- Client is added to Client's List
- Property is added to Property's List
- Pair is added to Pairing's List

When client, property and pairing is added, text will be appended to the text file as shown below:

- `Client`: Appends `CLIENT_NAME | CLIENT_CONTACT_NUMBER | CLIENT_EMAIL | CLIENT_BUDGET` to `client.txt`.
- `Property`: Appends `LANDLORD_NAME | PROPERTY_ADDRESS | PROPERTY_RENTAL_RATE | PROPERTY_UNIT_TYPE` to `property.txt`.
- `Pair`: Appends `[CLIENT_NAME | CLIENT_CONTACT_NUMBER | CLIENT_EMAIL | CLIENT_BUDGET] : [LANDLORD_NAME | 
PROPERTY_ADDRESS | PROPERTY_RENTAL_RATE | PROPERTY_UNIT_TYPE]` to `pair.txt`.

### Updating data

Updating of data occurs in 6 instances of operation:

- Client is deleted from Client List - `delete -client` command invoked
- Property is deleted from Property List - `delete -property` command invoked
- Pair is removed from Pairing List - `unpair` command invoked
- Incorrect data identified when loading of Client from `client.txt`
- Incorrect data identified when loading of Property from `property.txt`
- Missing Client or Property when loading Pairs from `pair.txt`

When the updating operation occurs, it will iterate through the list, depending on which list has been updated.
While iterating through the list, the program will **convert each entry into the correct format** and **store in their 
respective text files.**

### Manual input of data

Since the data is stored in a text file, it **allows for user to manually key in the entries** and will be loaded
when the program is re-ran.

This is how the entries should be stored :

Client: `CLIENT_NAME | CLIENT_CONTACT_NUMBER | CLIENT_EMAIL | CLIENT_BUDGET`

Property: `LANDLORD_NAME | PROPERTY_ADDRESS | PROPERTY_RENTAL_RATE | PROPERTY_UNIT_TYPE`

Pairing: `[CLIENT_NAME | CLIENT_CONTACT_NUMBER | CLIENT_EMAIL | CLIENT_BUDGET] : [LANDLORD_NAME | PROPERTY_ADDRESS |
PROPERTY_RENTAL_RATE | PROPERTY_UNIT_TYPE]`

Note that if the entries are stored incorrectly, the program will automatically remove the entries from the text file
during the next run of the program. This is done so to **prevent overcrowding** of junk data.
